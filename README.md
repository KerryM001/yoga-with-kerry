## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
​​
* Users interested in yoga
* Users interested in a escaping the rush of city life
* Users interested in exercise in Dublin area
​
### **User Stories:**
​​
* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate the page to find what I require quickly and easily.
* As a user, I want to learn more about what the business offers
* As a user, I want to reach out and contact the business
​
### **Site Aims:**
​​
* To inform the user on class times
* To inform the user about the business in general
* To offer the user an opportunity to get in contact
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​​
For the page I decided on a beige (#e09f7d) and teal theme (#97B1A6) as I find these colors really calming, and I think this ties in well with yoga in general. I chose to keep the font as black (0,0,0) as from an accessibility point of view, it's easy to read.
​
## **Typography**
​​
* Throughout the page, there is one main font used:
  * Oswald - I used this font as I think that it's nice to look at, and it is very easy to read.
  * Sans serif - This was a fallback font.
  * All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*
​
* The user is given links to each section of the page, and when clicked, these bring the user to the section.
* Each option is clear and easy to read.
* It minimises to a column when seen on smaller screens, to provide better user experience.
​
#### *features
​
* Logo: I used Oswald font as I think it's easy to read, and looks good. 
* I made the font larger than the rest of the page, so it stands out, and it makes it obviously that it's the page logo. 
* I chose to keep the font as black as from an accessibility point of view, it's easy to read.

* Hero Image: I chose this image as I think that it encaptures the energy that I wanted to bring to the webpage. 
* I think it shows clearly that the page is for a yoga business.

![hero-image](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/yoga-hero.jpg)

* Navigation Bar: I used this type of menu, as I think it creates a better user experience, when seen on smaller screens. 

![navigation-bar-1](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/navigation-bar-1.png)

![navigation-bar-2](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/navigation-bar-2.png)

* About section: I used Oswald font as I think it's easy to read, and looks good. 
* I used this section to inform the potential customer about the business in general. 
* I added a background color of teal around this section, to make it stand out to the user.

![about](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/about.png)

* Timetable section: I used Oswald font as I think it's easy to read, and looks good. 
* This section informs the user of the times of the classes, so they can see what suits them best. 
* I added a background color of teal around this section, to make it stand out to the user.

![timetable](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/timetable.png)

* Sign up section: I made the first name and email mandatory to submit the form. 
* I made the last name optional, as it's ok if users don't want to provide their full name. 
* I added a background color of teal around this section, to make it stand out to the user.

![sign-up-form](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/sign-up-form.png)

* Contact Us section: I used Oswald font as I think it's easy to read, and looks good. 
* This section provides the contact details of the business to the user, in case they have any questions. 
* I formatted this in an unordered list, to make it clearer to the user. 
* I also added a background color of teal around this section, to make it stand out to the user.

![contact-us](../yoga-with-kerry/assets/css/docs/contact-us.png)

* Social Media links: I styled these with icons from https://fontawesome.com/ and once clicked, they link out externally. 
* This provides a better user experience, while also being helpful to the business, as it means that the potential customer stays on the businesses' website.

​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​​
* At the time of making this page, I didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email would be something I'd like to learn, as this would improve user experience.
​
* I would have also liked to have added a page where you could actually book yoga classes, but I'm sure how to go about it at this time. I think this would really boost the businesses' page, as it makes it easier for people to commit to classes.
​
## **Testing Phase**​

* Responsiveness - I used https://amiresponsive.co.uk/ to test how responsive the site was on different screensizes.
​
* Functionality - I tested my navigation bar by clicking each link, to make sure that it brought you to the right section of the page.
* I tested the social media links by clicking each link, to make sure that they brought you to the site externally.
* I tested the sign up form by trying to sign up without entering an email, this works as the form doesn't allow you to proceed without a first name or email, as I intended.
​
* Validators - Please see below the results from w3c html validator and css jigsaw.
